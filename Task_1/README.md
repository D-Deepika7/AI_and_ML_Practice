# Task 1: Understanding Dataset & Data (Titanic Dataset)

## Project Overview
The objective of this task is to understand the structure, feature types, data quality, and machine learning readiness of the Titanic dataset using Python and Pandas.

---

## Objectives
- Load and inspect the Titanic dataset
- Identify numerical, categorical, ordinal, and binary features
- Analyze missing values and data quality issues
- Identify target and input features for machine learning
- Evaluate dataset suitability for ML models

---

## Dataset
- Name: Titanic Dataset
- Records: 891 rows × 12 columns
- Type: Supervised learning dataset
- Target Variable: Survived (0 = Not Survived, 1 = Survived)
- Commonly used for binary classification problems

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Key Observations
- The dataset contains both numerical and categorical features
- Missing values are present in Age, Cabin, and Embarked columns
- The target variable shows moderate class imbalance
- Categorical features require encoding before model training
- Dataset size is suitable for traditional machine learning algorithms

---

## Machine Learning Readiness
The Titanic dataset is suitable for supervised machine learning tasks such as classification.  
Preprocessing steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and addressing class imbalance are required before model training.
